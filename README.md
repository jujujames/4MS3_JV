# transit-service-equity

<!-- badges: start -->

This project is based on Rafael Periera’s 2022 paper titled Exploring
the Time Geography of Public Transit Networks. I have replicated his
methods and analysis with data from Toronto and the Toronto Transit
Commission (TTC) by adapting Rafael’s scripts found at
<https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps-time_geography>.

TO-DO:

1.  Julian, write a README to describe your project (what it is, what it
    does, how to replicate it).

2.  Convert the scripts in the `R` folder to computational notebooks,
    possibly qmd.

3.  Pycnophilactic interpolation of population. Need to discuss this.

4.  Recalculation of level of service to weight it by population: after
    all, transit serves people, not land.
